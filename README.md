# MARTY Demo - Muon Sector

Muon sector example (self-energy + anomalous magnetic moment) using `MARTY` in a simple `QED` model.

To download and install `MARTY` follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/docbrown1955/marty-public).

## Summary

The example presents the complete calculation, including the model building, of:
 - The muon self-energy (divergent contribution to an off-shell one-loop amplitude)
 - The muon anomalous magnetic moment `(g-2)Âµ` at the one-loop level

## Execute the MARTY program

Just type
``` bash
  make
  ./main
```
In case the compilation does not work, just change the compiler in the `Makefile` to set it to your `C++` compiler.

The model will be displayed and several results of calculations. The program will ask for input step-by-step just to pause the program, and `GRAFED` will be launched displaying the relevant Feynman diagrams for the unique vertex in the theory and the two calculations (self-energy and magnetic moment).

## Execute the numerical example the check the numbers

Just type
``` bash
cp example_demolib.cpp demolib/script
cd demolib
make
bin/example_demolib.x
```
This will execute the program and evaluate the quantities that have been calculated to compare them to their theoretical values.
